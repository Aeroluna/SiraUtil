# SiraUtil

SiraUtil is a powerful utility mod which expands the capabilities and provides more tools to Beat Saber modders.

## This is in my mods folder! Do I need it?

Probably! Many mods like ScoreSaber, Saber Factory, Custom Notes, and more depend on this mod for them to work, so don't uninstall it!

## Features

SiraUtil is a framework-like utility mod, but also brings some real features to the table.

- FPFC Toggling: By default, when FPFC is installed and you use the `fpfc` launch argument, you will be able to toggle in and out of FPFC with `G` by default. That keybind can be changed along with other settings in `UserData/SiraUtil.json`.

- Song Control: By default, when in a song, you can press `Esc` to exit the song, `F2` to pause/un-pause, and `F4` to restart. These keybinds can be changed in `UserData/SiraUtil.json`.
